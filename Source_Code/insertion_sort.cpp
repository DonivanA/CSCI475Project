insertion sort

/* Steps to take for insertion sort
1. We need an array, select the pivot, divide into processes
2. we separate the elements <= pivot into front of each processes
3. move all elements <= pivot into front of entire array
4. assign elements to processes (but we need to keep processes separate from last pivot)
5. repeat to 1 until each process is sorted.
